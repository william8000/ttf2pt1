<h2><font face=helvetica>New Features</font></h2>
<ul>
<li> New Unicode map format with glyph names, by Petr Titera. 
<li> Option to force the Unicode encoding by Petr Titera (I 
changed it to work on any MS encoding, not only Symbol). 
<li> Slightly tweaked the calculation of hints, should be better now. 
</ul>
<h2><font face=helvetica> Bux fixes:</font></h2>
<ul>
<li> The unicode-sample.map with description of the map formats 
was lost in the release process, restored and enhanced. 
<li> Renamed the table ISOLatin1Encoding to Fmt3Encoding to 
reflect the way it is used. Saved the original one for 
reference purposes.
In the new table renamed "quoteright" to "quotesingle" as 
Thomas Henlich suggested (and he was right). 
<li> In the ISOLatinEncoding table renamed the glyph "grave" 
at octal 0140 to "quoteleft", "quotesingle" at octal 047 
to "quoteright" to conform to the standard (as suggested by 
Martin Trautner). 
<li> Fixed bug in scripts/trans that corrupted the UniqueID 
record in the translated fonts. 
<li> Fixed bug in interaction of substituted hints with 
BlueZones. Now the fonts with hint substitution seem to 
be always at least not worse than without it (well, when 
they fit in the X11 file size limit). 
</ul>

</th></tr><tr><td>
Submitted by
Sergey Babkin: combined changes with the changes by
Thomas Henlich. The result deserves a not-so-minor version
increase.
<h2><font face=helvetica>New Features</font></h2>
<ul>
<li> Support of the external Unicode re-encoding maps
  (by Thomas).
<li> Support for inclusion of all the glyphs from the
  source file into the resulting file (inspired by
  Thomas but I re-implemented it to remove the limitation
  of his implementation: not more than 1024 glyphs).
<li> The hints substitution. It's an experimental feature
  yet and needs further work.
<li> Support for UniqueID and its auto-generation.
<li> Support for the name-based conversions from Unicode
  in general and the adobestd "language" in particular.
<li> Started the split of the source code into multiple
  files. This needs more work to do it in a cleaner
  way.
<li> Better framework for the debugging printout
  in the converter.
<li> Utilities to install the fonts in Netscape 
  Navigator/Communicator 4.x.
<li> Patches for bigger font files in the X11 rasterizer.
<li> Linux RPM spec-file (by Johan Vromans).
<li> Added the COPYRIGHT file (BSD-style, as we discussed
  on the mailing list earlier) and the CHANGES file.
<li> Creation of the .pfb files from the convert
  script.
<li> Changed the .notdef-s in the built-in
  ISOLatin1Encoding table to some valid names (by Thomas).
  Thomas also suggested replacing `quoteright' by
  `quotesingle' but this seems to be against the
  Adobe ISOLatin1 table.
<li> New aliases windows-1251 and cp-866 for
  the Russian encodings: those are expected by Netscape
  navigator.
<li> The font comparison program other/cmpf.
<li> The "magnifying glass" program for glyph outlines:
  other/showg.
<li> Other updates of the tools in the `other' subdirectory.
<li> Added a link to T1LIB in README.
<li> A few new options in convert.cfg.
</ul>
<h2><font face=helvetica> Bux fixes:</font></h2>
<ul>
<li> A bug in the outline smoothing code that corrupted some
  of the fonts (for example, Microsoft Verdana).
<li> Added explicit `cleartomark' to the end of file,
  this seems to be compatible with both old and new version
  of t1asm (suggested by Thomas).
<li> Added the FontEncoding statement to the AFM files
  (techincally this was not a bug because this statement
  is optional but some programs want it).
<li> A coredump when the converter tried to print a warning
  (rather ironically) about a weird glyph width.
<li> Changed the underscores in the font names to dashes (this
  has been proposed long time ago by someone, can't find
  now by whom - probably by Thomas henlich or Johan Vromans).
<li> No more glyph names of font names staring with a digit.
<li> The names of the fonts in font and AFM files are now the
  same as in the generated Ghostscript Fontmap file.
  Warning: the names in Fontmap have been
  changed.
<li> The forceiso script does not corrupt the character
  and kerning pairs counts any more, and is optional at all.
<li> Fix for a loop going to 254 instead of 255 (by Thomas).
<li> Added ':' in the font header (by Thomas).
<li> A coredump when wrong language name is given (this was
  also fixed by Thomas but I noticed it too late, after
  I already fixed it by myself).
<li> Fixed the links to the Adobe documents in README.

</ul>

<ul>
<li> (FINALLY!!!) a correct fix for the infamous Red Hat 6.0 stdio "feature",
<li> a number of little bugs discovered by a picky SGI compiler (well, maybe
some day I'll try to run it through the UnixWare lint and see what happens),    
<li> a diagnostic message about the empty encodings in the convert script was
made less cryptic and a bug in the awk sub-script was fixed,                    
<li> the .afm creation code now considers the option -t.                           
Features:                                                                       
<li> added support for the Bulgarian language (actually, for now just an alias
of Russian),                                                                    
<li> added option -w that tries to make sure that the character widths are not
too narrow,                                                                     
<li> added the concept of aliased encodings,
<li> now the conversion scripts create and install the .afm files too,
<li> the conversion script removes the intermediate files after installation,
<li> added tunables to the conversion script,
<li> installation of the Ghostscript fonts can now be done automatically
together with the X11 fonts.  Updated the docs.

language support by Turgut Uyar and Baltic (ISO8859/4) languages support by

<LI> improved (although still not perfect) handling of
scaling in composite glyphs
<LI> scaling of fonts to 1000x1000 M-square required by
Type1 standard
<LI> printing out the contours in reverse direction, because
TTF directions are different from Type1 ones (that was
the major reason why the fonts generated by
version 2.2 were rendered so badly in small sizes)
<LI>automatic correction of outlines to make them more
smooth (to correct both rounding errors introduced
during conversion and present in the original font)
<LI>automatic generation of hints (still has lots of
space for improvement)
<LI>automatic generation of BlueValues etc.
