<h2><font face=helvetica>New Features</font></h2>
<ul>
<li> Cyrillic (full set of glyphs) language tables (by Zvezdan Petkovic).
  Now the languages "russian" and "bulgarian" are provided for compatibility
  only, use the common language "cyrillic" instead.
<li> More information in <a href="FONTS.html">FONTS</a> on using Cyrillic fonts with 
  Netscape (by Zvezdan Petkovic)
<li> In the Netscape print filter added removal of the clipping path command:
  otherwise Netscape tends to cut off a large piece of the rightmost column
  of the tables.
<li> One more script for printing from Netscape (by Zvezdan Petkovic).
<li> Added selection of the base TTF encoding by pid/eid in the external maps.
<li> Improved the recognition of substituted stems for intersecting contours.
<li> Improved the substituted hints to make the horizontal positioning of
  the points at the same height more uniform at small pixel sizes.
<li> Made the algorithm for calculation of standard stem widths more
  selective.
<li> Added link to the GnuWin32 project.
</ul>
<h2><font face=helvetica>Bug fixes:</font></h2>
<ul>
<li> TH: Print out metrics of un-encoded glyphs even without "-a" option.
<li> Added missing "/" in Fontmap generation in convert (by Zvezdan Petkovic).
<li> Removed unneccessary "\n" in messages in x2gs.
<li> Removed the broken overoptimisation of "0 0 rmoveto".
<li> Removed the useless warnings about multiple codes for a glyph.
<li> Changed the FreeType2 include directory in the Makefile to match the
  FreeType's default.

  copied all files into the share directory.
<li> Fixed the close sequences of html2man comments in the HTML files, 
  now they should display correctly with <tt>lynx</tt>.
<li> Restored the ability to include un-encoded characters into the
  customised maps (those with codes over 255).
<li> Fixed the Unicode mapping of the Cyrillic letters "YO" and  "yo"

  <li> guessing of missing glyph names in a comparison file by code;
  <li> bounding boxes of all comparison files are used for page layout.
</ul>
<li> Added ability to use external t1asm instead of compiling it in.
<li> Renamed the fonts installation guide from INSTALL*html to FONTS*html
  to avoid confusion with installation of ttf2pt1 itself.

<h2><font face=helvetica>New Features</font></h2>
<ul>
<li>
Converted most of the outlines' processing to floating point
arithmetic.
<li>
Added splitting of curves crossing the quadrant boundaries (no gross 
damage is done any more to the Marvosym font and others like it).
<li>
Added modular interface for front-end font parsers and option to control
their selection at run time.
<li>
Grouped the outline processing control options into one to reduce the
options namespace pollution.
<li>
Thomas moved the Chinese maps into a separate module, chinese-maps.
<li>
Thomas added option -V to print version number. In addition, the version
number is put in the header of the font file.
<li>
Added long option names (suggested by Thomas).
<li>
Added support for multi-level composite glyphs.
<li>
TH: Made &lt;fontname&gt; command-line argument optional; default to &lt;ttf-file&gt;
with suffix replaced.
<li>
In <tt>other/showg</tt> added more ways to specify glyphs and the comparison option.
</ul>
<h2><font face=helvetica>Bug fixes:</font></h2>
<ul>
<li>
Fixed the VC++ batch file, added batch file for Cygnus GCC on Windows.
<li>
Removed parentheses from the Version string in AFM files because it does
not help StarOffice anyway. StarOffice 5.2 has been reported to have this
bug fixed. Added paragraph on StarOffice in INSTALL.html.
<li>
Made messages on the '?' option parameter more meaningful (by Johan Vromans).
<li>
Changed the latin1 encoding table to include the Euro sign, Z and z with
caron (by Thomas Henlich).

<h2><font face=helvetica>New Features</font></h2>
<ul>
<li>
Included windows support by Frank Siegert (somewhat amended)
<li>
Added control over verbosity of warnings.
<li>
Added arguments and initialization functions to the language
translation routines.
<li>
Added support of planes determined by arguments to the external
maps.
<li>
Added compact external maps format (primarily for Eastern fonts).
<li>
Added external maps for Chinese GBK and Big5 encodings (converted
from ttf2pfb) as well as maps for other Chinese encodings by Wang Lei.
<li>
Added the idea of buckets to speed up the search in external maps.
<li>
Changed the grouping algorithm for substituted hints: now it creates
a bit bigger files but requires smaller hint stack when being rendered.
<li>
Added maximal limit of hint stack depth, glyphs requiring bigger 
stack get generation of substituted hints disabled. This makes substituted 
hints safe to use, no more lost glyphs due to hint stack overflow.
<li>
Added the font dump program <tt>other/dumpf</tt>.
<li>
Changed the testing HTML generator <tt>other/lst.pl</tt> to use tables.
<li>
Added debugging script <tt>other/cntstems.pl</tt> to count required hint
stack depth for the glyphs.
</ul>
<h2><font face=helvetica>Bug fixes:</font></h2>
<ul>
<li>
Fixed printing of UID in script/trans. Changed the auto-generated UID to
be in range 4000000-4999999 which is reserved by Adobe for private use.
<li>
Fixed handling of "cleartomark" in built-in t1asm.
<li>
Added handling of "can't happen" case in straighten() routine
which actually happened on strange fonts and caused failure on assertion.
<li>
Made it always include the glyph .notdef in the resulting font.
<li>
Placed the version string in AFM file in parentheses, hopefully
that would fix the problem with StarOffice.
<li>
Improved the smoothing code which occasionally had problems with
joining curves.

<ul>
<li> New Unicode map format with glyph names, by Petr Titera. 
<li> Option to force the Unicode encoding by Petr Titera (I 
changed it to work on any MS encoding, not only Symbol). 
<li> Slightly tweaked the calculation of hints, should be better now. 
</ul>
<h2><font face=helvetica>Bug fixes:</font></h2>
<ul>
<li> The unicode-sample.map with description of the map formats 
was lost in the release process, restored and enhanced. 
<li> Renamed the table ISOLatin1Encoding to Fmt3Encoding to 
reflect the way it is used. Saved the original one for 
reference purposes.
In the new table renamed "quoteright" to "quotesingle" as 
Thomas Henlich suggested (and he was right). 
<li> In the ISOLatinEncoding table renamed the glyph "grave" 
at octal 0140 to "quoteleft", "quotesingle" at octal 047 
to "quoteright" to conform to the standard (as suggested by 
Martin Trautner). 
<li> Fixed bug in scripts/trans that corrupted the UniqueID 
record in the translated fonts. 
<li> Fixed bug in interaction of substituted hints with 
BlueZones. Now the fonts with hint substitution seem to 
be always at least not worse than without it (well, when 
they fit in the X11 file size limit).

Submitted by
Sergey Babkin: combined changes with the changes by
Thomas Henlich. The result deserves a not-so-minor version
increase.
<h2><font face=helvetica>New Features</font></h2>
<ul>
<li> Support of the external Unicode re-encoding maps
  (by Thomas).
<li> Support for inclusion of all the glyphs from the
  source file into the resulting file (inspired by
  Thomas but I re-implemented it to remove the limitation
  of his implementation: not more than 1024 glyphs).
<li> The hints substitution. It's an experimental feature
  yet and needs further work.
<li> Support for UniqueID and its auto-generation.
<li> Support for the name-based conversions from Unicode
  in general and the adobestd "language" in particular.
<li> Started the split of the source code into multiple
  files. This needs more work to do it in a cleaner
  way.
<li> Better framework for the debugging printout
  in the converter.
<li> Utilities to install the fonts in Netscape 
  Navigator/Communicator 4.x.
<li> Patches for bigger font files in the X11 rasterizer.
<li> Linux RPM spec-file (by Johan Vromans).
<li> Added the COPYRIGHT file (BSD-style, as we discussed
  on the mailing list earlier) and the CHANGES file.
<li> Creation of the .pfb files from the convert
  script.
<li> Changed the .notdef-s in the built-in
  ISOLatin1Encoding table to some valid names (by Thomas).
  Thomas also suggested replacing `quoteright' by
  `quotesingle' but this seems to be against the
  Adobe ISOLatin1 table.
<li> New aliases windows-1251 and cp-866 for
  the Russian encodings: those are expected by Netscape
  navigator.
<li> The font comparison program other/cmpf.
<li> The "magnifying glass" program for glyph outlines:
  other/showg.
<li> Other updates of the tools in the `other' subdirectory.
<li> Added a link to T1LIB in README.
<li> A few new options in convert.cfg.
</ul>
<h2><font face=helvetica>Bug fixes:</font></h2>
<ul>
<li> A bug in the outline smoothing code that corrupted some
  of the fonts (for example, Microsoft Verdana).
<li> Added explicit `cleartomark' to the end of file,
  this seems to be compatible with both old and new version
  of t1asm (suggested by Thomas).
<li> Added the FontEncoding statement to the AFM files
  (techincally this was not a bug because this statement
  is optional but some programs want it).
<li> A coredump when the converter tried to print a warning
  (rather ironically) about a weird glyph width.
<li> Changed the underscores in the font names to dashes (this
  has been proposed long time ago by someone, can't find
  now by whom - probably by Thomas henlich or Johan Vromans).
<li> No more glyph names of font names staring with a digit.
<li> The names of the fonts in font and AFM files are now the
  same as in the generated Ghostscript Fontmap file.
  Warning: the names in Fontmap have been
  changed.
<li> The forceiso script does not corrupt the character
  and kerning pairs counts any more, and is optional at all.
<li> Fix for a loop going to 254 instead of 255 (by Thomas).
<li> Added ':' in the font header (by Thomas).
<li> A coredump when wrong language name is given (this was
  also fixed by Thomas but I noticed it too late, after
  I already fixed it by myself).
<li> Fixed the links to the Adobe documents in README.
