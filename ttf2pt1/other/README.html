<h4><tt>bz</tt></h4>

A small program to draw the Bezier curves on an alphanumeric display.
The recommended way of uing it is to run it from xterm with "Tiny"
(if you want higher magnification) or "Unreadable" (if you want
higher resolution) font and as big window size as possible. The size
of the window can be obtained by running "<tt>stty -a</tt>". For everything else 
just "Use the source, Luke!"
<p>

<h4><tt>cmpf</tt></h4>

A small program to compare the rendering of two supposedly
nearly-identical fonts at low resolutions. It requires the
T1LIB library. This program may be used to compare the
effect of various options of the converter on the resulting
fonts. Create two <tt>.pfa</tt> files, one with one set of options,
another with another set of options, then use this program
to compare them.

<h4><tt>lst.pl</tt></h4>
<!

A simple PERL script that generates an HTML file
with the full list of all characters in all
possible styles of the Variable-width and Fixed-width
fonts. This file is quite convenient to look
at the converted fonts in Netscape (or other
graphical browser).

<h4><tt>showg</tt></h4>
<!
-----
>

A PERL script that draws the glyphs and their interesting
metrics (such as coordinates of the dots, hints and blue zones)
in PostScript. It works only with un-encoded font files.
The intended use is like:
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>showg <i>&lt;fontfile.t1a&gt; &lt;glyph-code&gt;</i>... &gt;file.ps</tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>gv file.ps # start the Ghostscript viewer</tt>
<p>

As you can see, multiple glyph codes may be specified. The
glyph codes are decimal. This program is quite valuable it you 
want to take a close-up view at the font.
<p>

The outlines are drawn in black, the ends of the curves and
lines are marked as dots, the first dots of the outlines
are fatter. The Blue Zones are drawn in light blue. The
substituted hints are marked in red, the global hints are
marked in blue. The coordinate grid is drawn in green.
The stems and the values of coordinates are for convenience
marked twice, on each size of the picture.
